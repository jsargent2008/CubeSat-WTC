QPACE Inital Test

Date: 5/4/2018
Tester: Clayton White

Unboxed Stack
	NOTE: 3.3 disable was in place
Connected: JTAG, 70cm primary, and MPPT power through X-Center
Removed 3.3 disable
Attemped JTAG connection
	Fail
Added 3.3 disable
Measured BT_Raw
	0 volts

Set supply to  4.9 V 700mA limits
Connected to MPPT power conn
	Immediate CC condition but voltage did not drop
	Immediate manual disconnection
Measured BT_Raw
	5.4 volts

Peliminary: batteries are discharged and chargers are trying to charge them
	causing an excessive current draw from the MPPT. Will attempt with lower
	current limit. Previous testing shows that the MPPT will not lower the 
	voltage on the supply, aka over draw it. 

Measuring Stack:
3.3		0.160 V
5		0.039 V
BT_Raw	5.400 V
12_Pwr	0.000 V
