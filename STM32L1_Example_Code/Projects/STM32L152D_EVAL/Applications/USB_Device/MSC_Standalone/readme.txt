@par Application Description

This application shows how to use the USB device application based on the Mass Storage Class (MSC).

This is a typical example on how to use the STM32L1xx USB Device peripheral to communicate with a PC
Host using the Bulk Only Transfer (BOT) and Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) transparent commands,
while the microSD card is used as storage media. The STM32 MCU is enumerated as a MSC device using the
native PC Host MSC driver to which the STM32L152D-EVAL board is connected.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals,
initialize the Flash interface and the systick. The user is provided with the SystemClock_Config()
function to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 32 MHz. The Full Speed (FS) USB module uses
internally a 48-MHz clock, which is generated from an integrated PLL.

When the application is started, the user has just to plug the USB cable into a PC host and the device
is automatically detected. A new removable drive appears in the system window and write/read/format
operations can be performed as with any other removable drive.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL configuration.

@note To reduce the example footprint, the toolchain dynamic allocation is replaced by a static allocation
      by returning the address of a pre-defined static buffer with the MSC class structure size.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with a STM32L152D-EVAL board embedding
    a STM32L152xD device and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

  - STM32L152D-EVAL Set-up
    - Insert a microSD card into the STM32L152D-EVAL uSD slot (CN3)
    - Connect the STM32L152D-EVAL board to the PC through 'USB Type A-Male
      to A-Male' cable to the connector
    - LCD Glass should be mounted On IO position for MicroSD usage.

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
