@par Example Description

This example describes how to configure and use GPIOs through the LL API to 
toggles the available users LEDs on the board each 250 ms. Peripheral initialization 
done using LL initialization function to demonstrate LL init usage.


PA.05 IO (configured in output pushpull mode) toggles in a forever loop.
On STM32L152RE-Nucleo Rev C board this IO is connected to LED2.

In this example, HCLK is configured at 32 MHz.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L152xE devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32L152RE-Nucleo Rev C board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
