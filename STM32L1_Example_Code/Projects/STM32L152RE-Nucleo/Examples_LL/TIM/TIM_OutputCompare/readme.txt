@par Example Description

This example shows how to configure the TIM peripheral to generate an output 
waveform in different output compare modes;
Example using the STM32L1xx TIM LL API, 
peripheral initialization done using LL unitary services functions
for optimization purpose (performance and size).

In this example TIM2 input clock (TIM2CLK) frequency is set to APB1 clock (PCLK1),
since APB1 pre-scaler is equal to 1.
    TIM2CLK = PCLK1
    PCLK1 = HCLK
    => TIM2CLK = HCLK = SystemCoreClock (32 Mhz)

To set the TIM2 counter clock frequency to 10 KHz, the pre-scaler (PSC) is
calculated as follows:
PSC = (TIM2CLK / TIM2 counter clock) - 1
PSC = (SystemCoreClock /10 KHz) - 1

SystemCoreClock is set to 32 MHz for STM32L1xx Devices.

Auto-reload (ARR) is calculated to get a time base period of 100 ms,
meaning a time base frequency of 10 Hz.
ARR = (TIM2 counter clock / time base frequency) - 1
ARR = (TIM2 counter clock / 10) - 1

The capture/compare register (CCR1) of the output channel is set to half the
auto-reload value. Therefore the timer output compare delay is 50 ms.
Generally speaking this delay is calculated as follows:
CC1_delay = TIM2 counter clock / CCR1

The timer output channel is mapped on the pin PA.05 (connected to LED2 on board
STM32L152RE-Nucleo Rev C). Thus LED2 status (on/off) mirrors the timer output
level (active v.s. inactive).

User push-button can be used to change the output compare mode:
  - When the output channel is configured in output compare toggle:  LED2 
    TOGGLES when the counter (CNT) matches the capture/compare register (CCR1).
  - When the output channel is configured in output compare active:  LED2 is
    switched ON when the counter (CNT) matches the capture/compare register
    (CCR1).
  - When the output channel is configured in output compare inactive:  LED2 is
    switched OFF when the counter (CNT) matches the capture/compare register
    (CCR1).
    
Initially the output channel is configured in output compare toggle mode.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L152xE devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32L152RE-Nucleo Rev C board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
