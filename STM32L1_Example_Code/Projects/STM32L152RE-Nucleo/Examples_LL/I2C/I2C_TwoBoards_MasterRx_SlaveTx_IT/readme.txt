@par Example Description
  
This example describes how to receive data byte from an I2C Slave device
using IT mode to an I2C Master device using IT mode. Peripheral initialization done
using LL unitary services functions for optimization purpose (performance and size).


This example guides you through the different configuration steps by mean of LL API
to configure GPIO and I2C peripherals using two STM32L152RE-Nucleo Rev C.

Boards: STM32L152RE-Nucleo Rev C (embeds a STM32L152RET6 device)
SCL Pin: PB.8 (CN10, pin 3)
SDA Pin: PB.9 (CN10, pin 5)

The project is splitted in two parts the Master Board and the Slave Board
- Master Board
  I2C1 Peripheral is configured in Master mode with EXTI (Fast Mode @400kHz).
And GPIO associated to User push-button is linked with EXTI. 
- Slave Board
  I2C1 Peripheral is configured in Slave mode with EXTI (Fast Mode @400kHz, Own address 7-bit enabled).

The user can choose between Master and Slave through "#define SLAVE_BOARD"
in the "main.h" file:
- Comment "#define SLAVE_BOARD" to select Master board.
- Uncomment "#define SLAVE_BOARD" to select Slave board.

LED2 blinks quickly on both BOARD to wait for user-button press. 

Example execution:
To perform this example, two steps are necessary to prevent a wrong start/stop detection due to the initialization of the oposite GPIO board.

So at first step, press the User push-button on BOARD SLAVE to activate Slave peripheral and then prepare acknowledge for Slave address reception.
At second step, press the User push-button on BOARD MASTER to activate Slave peripheral and then to initiate a read request by Master.
This action will generate an I2C start condition with the Slave address and a read bit condition.
When address Slave match code is received on I2C1 of BOARD SLAVE, an ADDR interrupt occurs.
I2C1 Slave IRQ Handler routine is then checking Address Match Code and direction Write (mean read direction for Master).
This will allow Slave to enter in transmitter mode and then send a byte when TXE interrupt occurs.
When byte is received on I2C1 of BOARD MASTER, an RXNE interrupt occurs.
When DR register is read, Master generate a NACK and a STOP condition
to inform the Slave that the transfer is finished.
The NACK condition generate a NACK interrupt in Slave side treated in the I2C1 Slave IRQ handler routine by a clear of NACK flag.
This NACK event initiate the end of transmission on Slave side

LED2 turn OFF on BOARD SLAVE when pressing the User push-button.

LED2 is On :
- Slave side if transfer sequence is completed.
- Master side if data is well received.

In case of errors, LED2 is blinking.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L152xE devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32L152RE-Nucleo Rev C board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L152RE-Nucleo Rev C Set-up
    - Connect GPIOs connected to Board Slave I2C1 SCL/SDA (PB.8 and PB.9)
    to respectively Board Master SCL and SDA pins of I2C1 (PB.8 and PB.9).
      - I2C1_SCL  PB.8 (CN10, pin 3) : connected to I2C1_SCL PB.8 (CN10, pin 3) 
      - I2C1_SDA  PB.9 (CN10, pin 5) : connected to I2C1_SDA PB.9 (CN10, pin 5)
    - Connect Master board GND to Slave Board GND

  - Launch the program. Press User push-button on Slave BOARD then on Master BOARD
      to initiate a read request by Master then Slave send a byte.

  - User can easily change the number of data to transfer by modifying
      the initialization of variables ubNbDataToTransmit and ubNbDataToReceive.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory (The user can choose between Master 
   and Slave target through "#define SLAVE_BOARD" in the "main.h" file)
    o Comment "#define SLAVE_BOARD" and load the project in Master Board
    o Uncomment "#define SLAVE_BOARD" and load the project in Slave Board
 - Run the example
