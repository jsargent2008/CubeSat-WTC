@par Example Description

This example describes how to exchange some datas between an I2C Master device
using DMA mode and an I2C Slave device using IT mode. Peripheral initialization done
using LL unitary services functions for optimization purpose (performance and size).

This example guides you through the different configuration steps by mean of LL API
to configure GPIO, DMA and I2C peripherals using only one STM32L152RE-Nucleo Rev C.

I2C1 Peripheral is configured in Slave mode with EXTI (Clock 400Khz, Own address 7-bit enabled).
I2C2 Peripheral is configured in Master mode with DMA (Clock 400Khz).
GPIO associated to User push-button is linked with EXTI. 

LED2 blinks quickly to wait for user-button press. 

Example execution:
Press the User push-button to initiate a write request by Master through Handle_I2C_Master_Transmit() or 
through Handle_I2C_Master_TransmitReceive() routine depends on Command Code type.

Command code type is decomposed in two categories :
1- Action Command code
    a. Type of command which need an action from Slave Device without send any specific anwser)
    b. I2C sequence is composed like that :
     _____________________________________________________________________________________
    |_START_|_Slave_Address_|_Wr_|_A_|_Command_Code_BYTE_1_|_A_|_Command_Code_BYTE_2_|_A_|....
     ________________________________
    |_Command_Code_BYTE_M_|_A_|_STOP_|

First of all, through Handle_I2C_Master_Transmit() routine, Master device generate an I2C start condition on the I2C bus.
When the I2C start condition is sent on I2C2, a SB interrupt occurs.
I2C2 IRQ Handler routine is then sending the Slave address with a write bit condition.
When address Slave match code is received on I2C1, the Slave acknowledge the address.
When this acknowledge is received on I2C2, an ADDR interrupt occurs.
I2C2 IRQ Handler routine is then enable the DMA transfer the Command code data from flash memory buffer to I2C2 DR register.

When address Slave match code is received on I2C1, an ADDR interrupt occurs.
I2C1 IRQ Handler routine is then checking Address Match Code and direction at Read (mean write direction for Master).
This will allow Slave to enter in receiver mode and then acknowledge Master to send the bytes through DMA.
Each time a byte is received on I2C1 (Slave), an RXNE interrupt occurs and byte is stored into an internal buffer
until a STOP condition.
And so each time the Slave acknowledge the byte received, DMA transfer the next data from flash memory buffer to I2C2 DR register
until Transfer completed.
Then Master generate a Stop condition when DMA transfer is achieved.

The STOP condition generate a STOP interrupt and initiate the end of reception on Slave side.
I2C1 IRQ handler routine is then clearing the STOP flag.

LED2 is On if data are well sent and the Command Code sent to slave is print in the Terminal I/O.

2- Request Command code :
    a. Type of command which need a specific data answer from Slave Device.
    b. I2C sequence is composed like that :
     _____________________________________________________________________________________
    |_START_|_Slave_Address_|_Wr_|_A_|_Command_Code_BYTE_1_|_A_|_Command_Code_BYTE_2_|_A_|....
     ______________________________________________________________________________
    |_Command_Code_BYTE_M_|_A_|_RESTART_|_Slave_Address_|_Rd_|_A_|_Data_BYTE_1_|_A_|...
     ___________________________________________
    |_Data_BYTE_2_|_A_|_Data_BYTE_N_|_NA_|_STOP_|

First of all, through Handle_I2C_Master_Transmit() routine, Master device generate an I2C start condition on the I2C bus.
When the I2C start condition is sent on I2C2, a SB interrupt occurs.
I2C2 IRQ Handler routine is then sending the Slave address with a write bit condition.
When address Slave match code is received on I2C1, the Slave acknowledge the address.
When this acknowledge is received on I2C2, an ADDR interrupt occurs.
I2C2 IRQ Handler routine is then enable the DMA transfer the Command code data from flash memory buffer to I2C2 DR register.

When address Slave match code is received on I2C1, an ADDR interrupt occurs.
I2C1 IRQ Handler routine is then checking Address Match Code and direction at Read (mean write direction for Master).
This will allow Slave to enter in receiver mode and then acknowledge Master to send the bytes through DMA.
Each time a byte is received on I2C1 (Slave), an RXNE interrupt occurs and byte is stored into an internal buffer
until a RESTART condition.
And so each time the Slave acknowledge the byte received, DMA transfer the next data from flash memory buffer to I2C2 DR register
until Transfer completed.
Then Master generate a RESTART condition when DMA transfer is achieved.

When the I2C restart condition is sent on I2C2, a SB interrupt occurs.
I2C2 IRQ Handler routine is then sending the Slave address with a read bit condition.
When address Slave match code is received on I2C1, the Slave acknowledge the address.
When this acknowledge is received on I2C2, an ADDR interrupt occurs.
I2C2 IRQ Handler routine is then enable the DMA transfer of the I2C2 DR register to an internal buffer
until end of transfer.

When address Slave match code is received on I2C1, an ADDR interrupt occurs.
I2C1 IRQ Handler routine is then checking Address Match Code and direction at Write (mean read direction for Master).
This will allow Slave to enter in transmitter mode and then send a byte when TXE interrupt occurs.
When byte is received on I2C2, an RXNE event occurs and DMA transfer data from DR register to an internal buffer
until end of transfer.

Then Master generate a STOP condition when DMA transfer is achieved.

The STOP condition generate a STOP interrupt and initiate the end of transmission on Slave side.
I2C1 IRQ handler routine is then clearing the STOP flag.

LED2 is On (500 ms) if data are well sent and the Command Code sent to slave is print as follow depending of IDE :
Note that
 - When resorting to EWARM IAR IDE:
 Command Code is displayed on debugger as follows: View --> Terminal I/O

 - When resorting to MDK-ARM KEIL IDE:
 Command Code is displayed on debugger as follows: View --> Serial Viewer --> Debug (printf) Viewer

- When resorting to AC6 SW4STM32 IDE:
 In Debug configuration window\ Startup, in addition to "monitor reset halt" add the command "monitor arm semihosting enable"
 Command Code is displayed on debugger as follows: Window--> Show View--> Console.

After each use cases, the LED2 blinks quickly to wait for a new user-button press to send a new Command code to the Slave device.

In all cases, if an error occurs, LED2 is blinking slowly.
