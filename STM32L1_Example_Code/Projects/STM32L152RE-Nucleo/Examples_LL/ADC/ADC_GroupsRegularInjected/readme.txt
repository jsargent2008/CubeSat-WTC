@par Example Description
This example describes how to use a ADC peripheral with both ADC groups
(ADC group regular and ADC group injected) in their intended use case; 
This example is based on the STM32L1xx ADC LL API; 
peripheral initialization done using LL unitary services functions
for optimization purpose (performance and size).

Description of ADC group regular and group injected intended use case:
 - group regular for a high number of conversions and continuous
   data stream, with DMA transfer capability.
 - group injected for punctual conversions inserted between
   conversions of group regular.


Example configuration:
ADC is configured to use the 2 groups:
 - ADC group regular:
   ADC is configured to convert a single channel (1 channel from a GPIO),
   in single conversion mode, from HW trigger: timer peripheral .
 - ADC group injected:
   ADC is configured to convert a single channel (1 internal channel: VrefInt),
   in single conversion mode, from SW trigger.
Other peripherals are configured to be used with ADC group regular:
DMA is configured to transfer conversion data in an array (DMA transfer can be used
only with ADC group regular).
A timer is configured in time base and to generate TRGO events (trig from
timer can be used with both ADC groups regular and injected).

Example execution:
From the main program execution, the ADC group regular converts the selected channel
at each trig from timer.
DMA transfers conversion data to the array, DMA transfer complete interruption occurs.
Results array is updated indefinitely (DMA in circular mode).

For debug: variables to monitor with debugger watch window:
 - "aADCxConvertedData": ADC group regular conversion data
 - "uhADCxGrpInjectedConvertedData": ADC group injected conversion data
 - "ubDmaTransferStatus": status of DMA transfer of ADC group regular conversions
 - "ubAdcGrpInjectedUnitaryConvStatus": status of ADC group injected unitary conversion

At each press on push button, the ADC group injected converts the selected channel
from a SW conversion start command.
ADC group injected conversion complete interruption occurs, SW transfers
conversion data to a variable, LED is turned on.

Connection needed:
None.
Note: Optionally, a voltage can be supplied to the analog input pin (cf pin below),
      between 0V and Vdda=3.3V, to perform a ADC conversion on a determined
      voltage level.
      Otherwise, this pin can be let floating (in this case ADC conversion data
      will be undetermined).

Other peripherals used:
  1 GPIO for push button
  1 GPIO for LED
  1 GPIO for analog input: PA.04 (Arduino connector CN8 pin A2, Morpho connector CN7 pin 32)
  DMA
  Timer

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L152xE devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32L152RE-Nucleo Rev C board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
