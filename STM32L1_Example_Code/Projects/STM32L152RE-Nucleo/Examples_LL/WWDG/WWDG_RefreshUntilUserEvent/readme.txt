@par Example Description

This example describes how to configure WWDG and update counter at regular period 
and generating an MCU WWDG reset at User Button pressed. Peripheral initialization 
done using LL unitary services functions for optimization purpose (performance and size).

Example Configuration:
Configure the WWDG (Window, Prescaler & Counter) and enable it.
Refresh the WWDG downcounter in the main loop - Led is blinking fastly & continuously

Example Execution:
When User Button is pressed, the Downcounter automatic refresh mechanism is disable and thus, reset will occur.
After a reset when re-entering in the main, RCC WWDG Reset Flag will be checked and if we are back from a WWDG reset the led will be switch ON.

Waiting a new user button pressed to re-activate the WWDG

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L152xE devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32L152RE-Nucleo Rev C board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
