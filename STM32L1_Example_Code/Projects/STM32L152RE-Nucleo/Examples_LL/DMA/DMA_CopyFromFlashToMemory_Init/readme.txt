@par Example Description

This example describes how to use a DMA channel to transfer a word data buffer
from Flash memory to embedded SRAM. Peripheral initialization done
using LL initialization function to demonstrate LL init usage.

At the beginning of the main program the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 32 MHz.

Then the LED_Init() function is used to initialize the LED2.

Then the Configure_DMA() function is used to configure the DMA1_Channel1 to transfer the contents of a 32-word data 
buffer stored in Flash memory to the reception buffer declared in RAM.

The start of transfer is triggered by software(LL_DMA_EnableChannel()). DMA1_Channel1 memory-to-memory
transfer is enabled. Source and destination addresses incrementing is also enabled.
The transfer is started by setting the channel enable bit for DMA1_Channel1.
At the end of the transfer a Transfer Complete interrupt is generated since it
is enabled and the callback function (customized by user) is called.

Finally, aSRC_Const_Buffer and aDST_Buffer are compared through Buffercmp() in order to 
check buffers correctness.  

STM32L152RE-Nucleo Rev C's LED can be used to monitor the transfer status:
- LED2 is turn on if DMA data transferred consistency.
- LED2 is blinking every 1 sec in case of error.
