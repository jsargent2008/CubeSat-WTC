@par Example Description

This example shows how to enter the system in STANDBY mode and wake-up from this
mode using external RESET or wake-up interrupt.

In the associated software, the system clock is set to 32 MHz, an EXTI line
is connected to the user button thru PC.13 and configured to generate an 
interrupt on falling edge upon key press.
LED2 is toggled each 200 ms in order to indicate that MCU is in RUN mode.

When a falling edge is detected on the EXTI line, an interrupt is generated. 
In the EXTI handler routine, the wake-up pin LL_PWR_WAKEUP_PIN1 is enabled and the 
corresponding wake-up flag cleared. Then, the system enters STANDBY mode causing 
LED2 to stop toggling. 

Next, a rising edge on PA.00 (connected to LL_PWR_WAKEUP_PIN1) will 
wake-up the system from STANDBY.
Alternatively, an external RESET of the board will lead to a system wake-up as well.

After wake-up from STANDBY mode, program execution restarts in the same way as 
after a RESET and LED2 restarts toggling.

LED2 is used to monitor the system state as follows:
 - LED2 fast toggling: system in RUN mode
 - LED2 slow toggling: system in RUN mode after exiting from standby mode
 - LED2 off : system in STANDBY mode

These steps are repeated in an infinite loop.

@note To measure the current consumption in STANDBY mode, remove JP6 jumper 
      and connect an ampere meter to JP6 to measure IDD current.     

@note This example can not be used in DEBUG mode due to the fact 
      that the Cortex-M3 core is no longer clocked during low power mode 
      so debugging features are disabled.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L152xE devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152RE-Nucleo Rev C
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

  - STM32L152RE-Nucleo Rev C Set-up
    - LED2 connected to PA.05 pin
    - Put a wire between PA.00 (connected to pin 28 on CN7 connector) and 
    3.3V pin (pin 5 on CN7) to generate a rising edge on LL_PWR_WAKEUP_PIN1.
    - WakeUp Pin LL_PWR_WAKEUP_PIN1 connected to PA.00

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
