@par Example Description

This example shows how to enter the system in STOP mode.

After start-up LED2 is toggling during 5 seconds, then the system automatically 
enter in STOP mode (Final state).

LED2 is used to monitor the system state as follows:
 - LED2 toggling : system in RUN mode
 - LED2 off : system in STOP mode

@note To measure the current consumption in STOP mode, remove JP6 jumper 
      and connect an ampere meter to JP6 to measure IDD current.     

@note This example can not be used in DEBUG mode due to the fact 
      that the Cortex-M3 core is no longer clocked during low power mode 
      so debugging features are disabled.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L152xE devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152RE-Nucleo Rev C
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.
