@par Example Description

This example describes how to configure the IWDG and insure counter update at 
regular period and generating an MCU IWDG reset at User Button pressed. Peripheral 
initialization done using LL unitary services functions for optimization purpose (performance and size).

Example Configuration:
Configure the IWDG (prescaler, counter) and enable it.
Infinite refresh of the IWDG down-counter done in the main loop.
Led is blinking fast & continuously

Example Execution:
When User Button is pressed, the down-counter automatic refresh mechanism is 
disable and thus, reset will occur. After a reset, when re-entering in the main, 
RCC IWDG Reset Flag will be checked and if we are back from a IWDG reset the led
will be switch ON.

Waiting a new user button pressed to re-activate the IWDG

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L152xE devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32L152RE-Nucleo Rev C board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
