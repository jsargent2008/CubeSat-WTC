@par Example Description

This example shows how to modify the PLL parameters in run time.

In this example, the toggling frequency of the green LED depends on the system clock 
frequency and, each time the user-button is pressed, the PLL switches between two configurations.
This make the led blinking speed to highlight the system clock frequency changes.

In this example, after start-up, SYSCLK is configured to the max frequency using the PLL with
HSI as clock source.
Then, at user-button press, an automatic switch is done between PLL with HSI as clock source (SYSCLK
set to 16MHz) and PLL with HSI as clock source (SYSCLK set to 32Hz). 
LED will toggle differently between the 2 configurations (quick toggle with HSI configuration at 32Hz).

To detect a problem with PLL configuration, switch USE_TIMEOUT can be enabled. Then in case of issues, 
LED will toggle every 1 second.
Note: "uwFrequency" variable can be added in LiveWatch to monitor the system clock frequency.
