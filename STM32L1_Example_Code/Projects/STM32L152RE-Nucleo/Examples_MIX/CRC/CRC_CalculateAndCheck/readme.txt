@par Example Description

This example provides a description of how to use CRC peripheral through 
the STM32L1xx CRC HAL & LL API (LL API used for performance improvement);
Fixed generator polynomial used in CRC IP is CRC-32 (Ethernet) polynomial: 0x4C11DB7.
First, the CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) calculation unit computes CRC code of 
a given buffer of 32-bit data words, using HAL APIs.
Then, in a second step, CRC calculation unit is reset, for new CRC calculation;
2nd calculation is started using CRC LL API.
Both calculated CRC codes are checked against expected value.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK).

The CRC peripheral configuration is ensured by HAL_CRC_Init() function.
The latter is calling HAL_CRC_MspInit() function which core is implementing
the configuration of the needed CRC resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK). 

For each computation, calculated CRC code is stored in uwCRCValue variable.
Once calculated, CRC value (uwCRCValue) is compared to the CRC expected value (uwExpectedCRCValue),
and if both checks are successful, LED is turned On. 
In case of errors, LED is blinking (1sec period).

STM32 board LED is used to monitor the example status:
  - LED2 is ON when correct CRC values are calculated
  - LED2 is slowly blinking (1 sec. period) when there is an error in initialization or if an incorrect CRC value is calculated.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.
