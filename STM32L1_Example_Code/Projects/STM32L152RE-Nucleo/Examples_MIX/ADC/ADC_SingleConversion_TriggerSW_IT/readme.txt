@par Example Description
This example describes how to use a ADC peripheral to perform 
a single ADC conversion of a channel, at each software start; 
Example using programming model: interrupt 
(for programming models polling or DMA transfer, refer to
other examples); 
This example is based on the STM32L1xx ADC HAL & LL API
(LL API used for performance improvement).

Example configuration:
ADC is configured to convert a single channel, in single conversion mode,
from SW trigger.
ADC interruption enabled: EOC (end of conversion of ADC group regular).

Example execution:
At each press on push button, the ADC performs 1 conversion of the selected channel.
When conversion is completed, ADC interruption occurs.
IRQ handler callback function reads conversion data from ADC data register
and stores it into a variable, LED is turned on.

For debug: variables to monitor with debugger watch window:
 - "uhADCxConvertedData": ADC group regular conversion data
 - "uhADCxConvertedData_Voltage_mVolt": ADC conversion data computation to physical values

Connection needed:
None, if ADC channel and DAC channel are selected on the same GPIO.
Otherwise, connect a wire between DAC channel output and ADC input.
See comment below related to literal "WAVEFORM_GENERATION".

Other peripherals used:
  1 GPIO for push button
  1 GPIO for LED
  1 GPIO for analog input: PA.04 (Arduino connector CN8 pin A2, Morpho connector CN7 pin 32)
  1 GPIO for DAC channel output PA.04 (Arduino connector CN8 pin A2, Morpho connector CN7 pin 32)

Compilation switches are available to customize configuration and execution of this example:

One compilation switch is available to generate a waveform voltage
for test (located in main.h):
 - If literal "WAVEFORM_GENERATION" is defined: For this example purpose, generates a
   waveform voltage on a spare DAC channel LL_DAC_CHANNEL_1 (pin PA.04)
   so user has just to connect a wire between DAC channel output and ADC input to run this example.
   If ADC channel and DAC channel are selected on the same GPIO, then no external wire is required.
   Waveform generation: waveform circular, shape of ramp: Voltage is increasing at each press on push button, 
                        from 0V to maximum range (Vdda) in 5 steps (with vdda=3.3V: 0V, 0.8V, 1.65V, 2.5V, 3.3V),
                        then starting back from 0V.
   and follows circular cycles: At clicks counter maximum value reached, counter is set back to 0.
 - If literal "WAVEFORM_GENERATION" is not defined: no voltage is generated, user has
   to connect a voltage source to the selected ADC channel input to run this example.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L152xE devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32L152RE-Nucleo Rev C board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
