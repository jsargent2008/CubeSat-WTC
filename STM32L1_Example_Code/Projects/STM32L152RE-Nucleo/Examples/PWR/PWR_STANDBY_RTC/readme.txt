@par Example Description 

This example shows how to enter the system in STANDBY mode and wake-up from this
mode using external RESET or RTC Wake-up Timer.
It allows to measure the current consumption in STANDBY mode with RTC enabled.


In the associated software, the system clock is set to 32 MHz, the SysTick is 
programmed to generate an interrupt each 1 ms.
The Low Speed Internal (LSI) clock is used as RTC clock source by default.

In the associated software
  - the system clock is set to 32 MHz.
  - the EXTI_Line20 connected internally to the RTC Wakeup event is configured
    to generate an interrupt on rising edge each 4s.
  - the SysTick is programmed to generate an interrupt each 1 ms. 

The system enters STANDBY mode after 5s and will wait for the RTC Wakeup timer event to be
generated each 4s. Current consumption could be monitored through an amperemeter.
After wake-up from STANDBY mode, program execution restarts in the same way as after
a RESET, the RTC configuration (clock source, prescaler,...). As result there is 
no need to configure the RTC.

The above scenario is repeated in an infinite loop.
 - LED2 ON: HAL configuration failed (system will go to an infinite loop)
 
    - STANDBY Mode with RTC clocked by LSI
    ===================================  
            - RTC Clocked by LSI
            - VREFINT OFF with fast wakeup enabled
            - No IWDG
            - Automatic Wakeup using RTC wakeup timer (after ~4s)

@note This example can not be used in DEBUG mode, this is due to the fact 
      that the Cortex-M3 core is no longer clocked during low power mode 
       so debugging features are disabled

@note Care must be taken when HAL_RCCEx_PeriphCLKConfig() is used to select 
      the RTC clock source; in this case the Backup domain will be reset in  
      order to modify the RTC Clock source, as consequence RTC registers (including 
      the backup registers) and RCC_CSR register are set to their reset values.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L152xE devices
    
      
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152RE-Nucleo Rev C
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32L152RE-Nucleo Rev C Set-up
    - Connect an amperemeter to JP6 to measure the IDD current

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
